# cryptocurrency_data_wrangling
This project focuses on data wrangling techniques and the ability to transform raw datasets into formats that help to answer interesting questions.
The approach to this:
Importing the necessary libaries
Understanding the data
Filtering unwanted observations
Pivoting the dataset
Shifting the dataset and meilting the shifted dataset
Reduce-merge the melted data
Aggregating the dataset using group-by

In order to analyze the cryptocurrency dataset, theres need to calculate returns over the prior 7,14,21 and 28 days plus a forward 7-day retun.
This was acheived by craeting an Analytical Base Table where each row contains all of the relevant information of a particular cryptocurrency coin on a particular date.
